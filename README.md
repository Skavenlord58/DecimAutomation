# DecimAutomation
## An automation bot for Discord

### Introduction
This bot will be used to automate DecimBot2's tasks in order to reduce overhead in the messy script I wrote for him.

### Some technical stuff
WIP

### Running it

_Dockerfile will be added some day_

Create an .env file and add this stuff to it:
```cfg
DISCORD_TOKEN={DISCORD_API_TOKEN} # cuz we won't push ours to the repo XD
BOT_PREFIX=ÃŸ
```
